<h1>Java DbC</h1>

<p><a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?DesignByContract">Design by Contract</a> support for Java.</p>

<h2>Why this?</h2>

<p>This project started life as a self-learning exercise for me, as much about writing Java annotations as about DbC as such, but it may actually prove to be useful for some people. </p>

<p>I've long considered DbC a useful technique for services (as well as library functions), as it helps the individual services to be less vulnerable to unexpected inputs and hidden side effects. I consider it one among a handful of key techniques that help us create resilient and reliable solutions. </p>

<p>As people embrace the idea of service-based solutions, sometimes taking the idea as far as "microservices", we have a larger number of small pieces and a larger number of interactions with code we don't control, all in an elastic environment in which server instances come and go while our applications remain available to users more-or-less continuously. </p>

<p>If each small piece is as solid as we can make it, then at least when something unexpected happens in production the small piece will behave in a predictable way. We probably will never achieve a zero-defect outcome, but we can at least apply all the skills and tools we know of to do the best we can.</p>

<p>It's also a reality now, if it wasn't already, that we can't configure a test environment to be close enough to live production to provide a high degree of confidence our application will behave in a reasonable way once it's out in the world and in use by humans and by client systems. DbC is not a testing technique; contracts are enforced at run time. That should make it appealing even for developers who consider unit testing a bad idea. </p>

<p>If we add to Design by Contract the idea of <a href="https://thenewstack.io/monitoring-and-observability-whats-the-difference-and-why-does-it-matter/"><em>observability</em></a> and we instrument our code to work with a proactive monitoring tool such as Honeycomb, (while remembering everything else we know about general software design principles, of course), then I would say we've exercised professional due diligence to make our application as reliable as possible. </p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>To check inbound argument values to enforce <em>preconditions</em>, annotate the arguments of the method that receives requests from client code (or method close to the beginning of the processing your application performs). Call <em>Constraints.check(...)</em> to have the library validate the inbound arguments to ensure they comply with the contract for calling your service. </p>

<p>To check your service's state to enforce <em>preconditions</em> or <em>postconditions</em> or to check <em>invariants</em>, define a method that accepts as arguments the values you need to check. Annotate those arguments appropriately, and call <em>Constraints.check(...)</em> on them. </p>

<p>When a value does not conform with a check, the library throws <em>ConstraintViolationException</em>. Catch that exception and deal with it however you need to. </p>

<p>Here is an example from the unit test suite: </p>

<pre>
    String blend(@NotBlank String val1, @NotBlank String val2) {
        Constraints.check(val1, val2);
        return val1 + val2;
    }
</pre>

<p>Client code calls the method this way: </p>

<pre>
    blend("something", "somethingElse");
</pre>

<p>Here is a more complicated example: </p>

<pre>
    void processMultipleConstraints(
            @NotNull @MinimumLength(value=5) @MaximumLength(value=20) @MustMatch(regex="^[a-zA-Z]+$") String someString,
            @NotNull @NotEmpty @MustContainKey(key="key1") @MustNotContainKey(key="key2") Map<String, String> testMap,
            @NotNull @MustBeInRangeExclusive(min=50, max=60) Integer someNumber,
            @NotNull @MinimumValue(value=10) Double someDouble
    ) {
        Constraints.check(someString, testMap, someNumber, someDouble);
    }
</pre>

<p>Client code calls the method this way:</p>

<pre>
    Map<String, String> testMap = new HashMap();
    testMap.put("key1", "value1");
    processMultipleConstraints(
        "Happy",
        testMap,
        55,
        14.89);
</pre>

<p>There is a known problem: You must include all the arguments passed into the method when you call <em>Constraints.check()</em> or the library will throw <em>IndexOutOfBoundsException</em>. This will be fixed in a future release. </p>

<p>An example: You should be able to write this:</p>

<pre>
    int add(@CustomConstraint(className="com.neopragma.dbc.EvenNumbersOnlyRule") int val1, int val2) {
        Constraints.check(val1);
        return val1 + val2;
    }
</pre>

<p>Instead, you must write this, even though you are not checking the second argument:</p>

<pre>
    int add(@CustomConstraint(className="com.neopragma.dbc.EvenNumbersOnlyRule") int val1, int val2) {
        Constraints.check(val1, val2);
        return val1 + val2;
    }
</pre>

<h2>Annotations</h2>

<p>There are several annotations that apply to <em>parameters</em> passed into methods. These can be used to enforce <em>preconditions</em> and <em>postconditions</em> and to check <em>invariants</em> as defined in the general model of DbC. Here is an alphabetical list. The <em>Constraints.check()</em> method will throw <em>ConstraintViolationException</em> (unchecked) when any constraint is not met. You can specify multiple annotations on the same parameter. </p>

<h3>@Blank</h3>

<p>Argument of type <em>String</em> must be an empty string or a null reference. </p>

<h3>@CustomConstraint(className = <em>classname</em>)</h3>

<p>You provide a class that implements interface <em>Rule</em> and provide the class name in the <em>className</em> attribute of the annotation. Annotate a parameter that you need to validate using custom logic. </p>

<h3>@Empty</h3>

<p>Argument of type <em>Collection</em> must be empty and not a null reference. This does not check for <em>null</em> and will throw <em>NullPointerException</em> when the argument is a null reference.</p>

<p>This and @NotEmpty work for <em>Map</em> types because the code recognizes the <em>Map</em> type and performs the "empty" test on just the <em>keySet()</em>. </p>

<h3>@MaximumLength(value = <em>n</em>)</h3>

<p>Argument of type <em>String</em> must not be longer than <em>n</em>.</p>

<h3>@MaximumValue(value = <em>n</em>)</h3>

<p>Argument of type <em>Number</em> must not exceed the value of <em>n</em>.</p>

<h3>@MinimumEntries(value = <em>n</em>)</h3>

<p>Argument of type <em>Collection</em> must contain at least <em>n</em> entries. </p>

<h3>@MinimumLength(value <em>n</em>)</h3>

<p>Argument of type <em>String</em> must be at least <em>n</em> characters long. </p>

<h3>@MinimumValue(value = <em>n</em>)</h3>

<p>Argument of type <em>Number</em> must not be less than the value of <em>n</em>.</p>

<h3>@MustBeInRangeExclusive(min = <em>min</em>, max = <em>max</em>)</h3>

<p>Argument of type <em>Number</em> must be between <em>min</em> and <em>max</em> exclusive. </p>

<h3>@MustBeInRangeInclusive(min = <em>min</em>, max = <em>max</em>)</h3>

<p>Argument of type <em>Number</em> must be between <em>min</em> and <em>max</em> inclusive. </p>

<h3>@MustBeOutisdeRange(min = <em>min</em>, max = <em>max</em>)</h3>

<p>Argument of type <em>Number</em> must outside the range between <em>min</em> and <em>max</em> inclusive. </p>

<h3>@MustContainKey(key = <em>value</em>)</h3>

<p>Argument of type <em>Map</em> must contain an entry whose key is <em>value</em>. </p>

<h3>@MustMatch(regex = <em>value</em>)</h3>

<p>Argument of type <em>String</em> must match the regular expression. This does not check for <em>null</em>. </p>

<h3>@MustNotContainKey(key = <em>value</em>)</h3>

<p>Argument of type <em>Map</em> must not contain an entry whose key is <em>value</em>. </p>

<h3>@MustNotMatch(regex = <em>value</em>)</h3>

<p>Argument of type <em>String</em> must not match the regular expression. This does not check for <em>null</em>. </p>

<h3>@NotBlank</h3>

<p>Argument of type <em>String</em> must be a string with a length of at least 1. </p>

<h3>@NotEmpty</h3>

<p>Argument of type <em>Collection</em> must contain at least one entry. This does not check for <em>null</em> and will throw <em>NullPointerException</em> when the argument is a null reference. Use in conjunction with @NotNull for cleaner behavior and better readability. </p>

<h3>@NotNull</h3>

<p>Argument of type <em>Object</em> must not be a null reference. </p>

<h3>@Null</h3>

<p>Argument of type <em>Object</em> must be a null reference. </p>

<h2>Arguments of type <em>Array</em></h2>

<p>The method client code calls to trigger verifying the contract is <em>Constraints.check(Object... args)</em>. Because of the way <em>varargs</em> are supported in Java, all the arguments get flattened into a single one-dimensional array. An effect is that the <em>check()</em> method can't distinguish between these two constructions: </p>

<pre>
void methodName(Integer a, Date d, String[4] s, Integer b)

void methodName(Object[] o) 
</pre>

<p>So if you call <em>methodName</em> like this: </p>

<pre>
methodName(16, new Date(), new String[] { "alpha", "beta", "delta", "gamma" }, 37)
</pre>

<p>The <em>check()</em> method sees this argument list:</p>

<pre>
Object [16, _date_, "alpha", "beta", "delta", "gamma", 37]
</pre>

<p>To enforce a contract involving an array argument, I suggest first converting the array into a <em>Collection</em> such as <em>List</em>. Unfortunately, you might have to extract a method just for the purpose of enforcing the contract on the array argument in order to avoid messing up the other arguments passed to your public method. </p>

<p>If the array argument is the only argument passed to the public method, then <em>check()</em> will only "see" the first entry in the array. If the array contains no entries, you'll get a <em>NullPointerException</em> because Java will think there is an argument but its value is <em>null</em>. So, the behavior with array arguments is inconsistent and almost certainly will not be what you want. </p>

<h2>Handling JSON input</h2>

<p>JSON documents are basically <em>String</em> values unless they are parsed or interpreted by code that understands the JSON format. To enforce a contract pertaining to a JSON document, I suggest first converting the document into a <em>Collection</em> such as <em>Map</em>, using your favorite JSON library. Then you can use the annotations that operate on <em>Collection</em> types. </p>

<p>I considered building this into the tool, but decided not to impose a dependency on a JSON library that might not be the one you prefer to use, or that might introduce a transitive dependency that causes problems later on as various other dependencies move to new versions.</p>
